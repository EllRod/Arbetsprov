  "description": "Instructions * Fork the repository * Create a Feature Branch * Implement a simple search function according to wireframes and UI (attached on github) * The search should use a public REST API of your choice using JavaScript * Search for title, return title (or something like that) * Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field * When hitting [ENTER] the selected search value should be saved with date/timestamp beneath the search box (as a search history) * The page should be responsive, so that if width of window is changed it should adapt * Nothing needs to be saved if the page is reloaded (i.e donâ€™t have to use cookies/database etc)",
